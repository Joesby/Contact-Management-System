Hello! Welcome to my Contact Management System!
To get started all you need to do is run the progam!
The system will welcome you and display a list of options to choose from to get you started.
After a lot of usage, things can get a little confusing. If you ever want to revisit the options again, enter '8' when entering a selection.
I've made sure to provide a lot of feedback to try to make sure the user can understand when something wasn't done correctly, but there may still
be a few issues to work around and sometimes the screen may get cluttered.

When importing contacts, my system is looking for some specific criteria:
    -contact information MUST be listed in this order: Name, Phone Number, Email, Address
    -information MUST be separated by a blank space, like so: Name_Phone Number_Email_Address
    -spaces within individual pieces of information is OK: i.e. 'Gary Indiana' will be recognized as a contact name so long as it's NOT written like 'Gary_Indiana'
    -for consistency and clarity, phone numbers SHOULD be writting in the following format: (xxx)_xxx-xxxx
    -the () are technically not needed but for consistency sake, it's better to include them. The _UNDERSCORE_ is NEEDED.
I've already identified better solutions that would make formatting import docs more user friendly, but this will have to do for the time being. 

Thank you.
